WHAT IS IT:
Create a cycling reminder to go rate your app at the App Store. Tracks 
the app launch count, and reminds the user every 20 launches (configurable) to 
rate the app, with a click to launch the app page in the App Store.

Reminders stop if the user clicks the "Rate Now" or "Don't Remind Me" options.

USAGE:
In your app.js (or elsewhere), call:
	Ti.include("rater.js");
	Rater.init("[Your app name]","[Your app's App Store ID]");
	Rater.run();
